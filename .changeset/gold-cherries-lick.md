updated all stories to Storybook 7.

> [!NOTE]
> Since multiple PR has been submitted and merged since the start of upgrade, new stories are under the folder `stories_v7`
>
> Developers that has contributed and altered existing stories **must** refactor to the new storybook.
>
> When all stories has been migrated, the `stories` folder, must be deleted, and `stories_v7` have the suffix removed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some stories might take too much effort to migrate _(like `Hanging garden`)_, these should be move to `__TODO__` folder, so it can be triage for later
