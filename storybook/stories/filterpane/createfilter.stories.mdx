# Create a custom filter

The filerprovider in built to be able to handle any type of filtering you might need.
While the filterpane comes with some built in filtertypes, they are only built to cover the most common use cases.

If you need something more specific, you have full freedom to do so.
Either by building from scratch or just simply taking the prebuilt components, and make your own take on them.

> It is recommended to be familiar with the FilterProvider when writing your own filter.  
> Check out the [Filter Provider page](?path=/docs/filterpane-filterprovider--page) for more details

## How to register your filter with the FilterProvider

To get the filterprovider to acknowledge your component, it needs to be registered with the filter provider store.
This can be done through the `useFilterContext` hook.
