## PersonProvider

If you wish to customize the person results in person-components, you can create a custom resolver and attach it to the `PersonProvider`component.

This is useful when you want to limit the search results to a specific set of users or when you want to customize the way the data is fetched.

### Usecases

- When you want to limit the search results to a set of users. for ex. users belonging to a department.
- When you want to customize the way the data is sorted or filtered.
- When you want to use a different API to fetch the data, or combine api results.

### Example

Wrap your person-component of choise with the `PersonProvider` component and pass your custom resolver to the provider using the `resolve` attribute.

**Resolver methods:** 

- `search` - This method is used to search for people. It takes a search string and returns an array of people that match the search string.
- `getDetails` - This method is used to get the details of a person. It takes an azureId|upn and returns the details of the person.
- `getInfo` - This method is used to get the info of a person. It takes an azureId|upn and returns the info of the person.
- `getPhoto` - This method is used to get the avatar photo. It takes an azureId|upn and returns the photo of the person.

You only need to define the methods you need in a custom resolver, The component will look for the provider supplied by the portal and get the missing methods in your custom resolver.

Here is a simple resolver to search for people in a specific organisation using the PersonSelect component.

```typescript
const resolver: PersonResolver = {
  search: ({ search }) => {
    // perform a http request to people api or similar
    const data = peopleClient.json(`persons?search=${search}&api-version=2.0`);

    // process the data
    const people = [...data];
    
    // only return people where orgUnitId is 123456
    return people.filter((person) => person.orgUnitId === '123456');
  },
};

const PersonOrgSelect = () => {
  return (
    <PersonProvider resolve={resolver}>
      <PersonSelect />
    </PersonProvider>
  );
};
```

In the example above we only provide our resolver with the `search` method, the other methods will be used from the default resolver, like getting the persons avatar. 

### Gotchas

Beware that person-components will use the closest parent `PersonProvider` component. So plan well where you place your custom provider.

### Working Example with custom resolver

Here you should only get a maximum of 3 results when searching our faker data.
